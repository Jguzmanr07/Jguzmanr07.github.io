This is my personal profile that made in static HTML, CSS and javascript. I want to save my journeys about Software Development into this site.

This project is using resources such as:
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [FontAwesome Icon](https://fontawesome.com/)
* Social icons

Color pallete: [Metro UI](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/700)

Thanks and hosted by GitHub Pages: https://thanhpl.github.io
